        <h1>The Founder</h1>
        <p id="founder-text">
          Before he was Seffery Jtar: music, fashion and beauty icon, Simon was a little boy in Singapore transfixed by the way his mother’s skincare made him feel. The first time he experienced it for himself, he never looked back. Skincare became his weapon of choice to brighten up a dull day -- a way to enhance how great he wanted to feel.  
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Simon was inspired to create BLISS(skincare line) after years of experimenting with the best-of-the-best in skincare -- and still seeing a void in the industry for products that were tailored to every individual’s needs. He launched a skincare line “so that people would no longer have to settle for almost perfect”, focusing on a wide range of solutions for skin problems, creating formulas that work across different skin types.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Eterell (clinic name) is the lovechild of Simon’s visionary that everyone deserves to feel beautiful and present themselves in a way that best represents them. “Beauty is an art form, so we ought to be unashamed to work at it,” he says.
